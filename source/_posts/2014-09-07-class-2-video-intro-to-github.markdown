Here's the video from class on Thursday:

For anyone on an older version of Mac OSX (especially anyone on 10.7),
I highly suggest upgrading to the latest version, 10.9. You can do so
for free. Apple
[has instructions on their site](https://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/)
if you need help, or you can ask Cornish IT Support or go to the Apple Store.
