###Instructions

Download the file below to a folder on your computer. I suggest a new
folder inside whatever folder you are already using for this
class.

You will need to create a CSS file called "style.css". There are 5
mandatory tasks and 3 optional tasks specified in the HTML. You should
generally be able to complete the assignment without editing the HTML
at all (just write CSS).

This assignment is due on Thursday.
