###Instructions

Similar to the previous assignment! Download the file below to a
folder on your computer. I suggest a new folder inside whatever folder
you are already using for this class.

You will need to create a CSS file called "style.css". There are 10
tasks specified in the HTML. You should generally be able to complete
the assignment without editing the HTML (just write CSS), although if
you want to add classes or ids in the HTML to make your life easier,
feel free.

This assignment is due on Thursday.
