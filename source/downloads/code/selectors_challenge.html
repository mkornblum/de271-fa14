    <h1>Selectors challenge</h1>

    <p>In this exercise you will start off with some ready-made HTML, and write some CSS to solve the problems set out in the following questions. You can find the ready-made HTML in the file <code>selectors_challenge.html</code>. Download a copy of this file to your computer and turn it in along with a CSS file of your creation.

      <div id="mandatory">

        <h2><a>Mandatory tasks</a></h2>

        <p>The basic, mandatory tasks are as follows. These are simple exercises designed to test your knowledge of CSS selectors. Each one of these should take you only a minute or so to apply, once you have got your style sheet set up. If you get stuck, refer back to Chapter 11 of the book.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Write a rule that will apply the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)" title="link to more information about the Georgia typeface">Georgia</a> font to every element on the Web page. Apply this rule to the HTML using whatever method you think is best.</li>
          <li>Give the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements a light-colored background (your choice), and apply 10 pixels of padding between the content inside the divs and their edges.</li>
          <li>Make whole page's content 500 pixels in width.</li>
          <li>Apply a dark-colored border (your choice of color and style) to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements.</li>
          <li>Override the previous font setting just for the headingsâ€”make every heading use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a> font (or another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif" title="Definition of the term sans-serif">sans-serif</a> font of your choice).</li>
        </ol>

      </div>

      <div id="advanced">

        <h2>Advanced optional tasks</h2>

        <p>The more advanced, optional tasks are as follows. These are more complicated tasks that will give you more of a challenge. Some of them will require a bit more research and implementation time than the basic tasks, but the information you require will still be available through the book or online.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Apply a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/drop_cap.html" title="Definition of drop cap">drop-cap</a> (increased-size first letter) to paragraphs that come directly after <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements, but no others.</li>
          <li>Apply pseudo-classes to the links so that they are a different color to the rest of the text, and when you mouse over them, the underline disappears.</li>
          <li>Use CSS3 selectors to give the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements rounded corners and a subtle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shadow">drop shadow</a>. The relevant properties may not work in older browsers.</li>
        </ol>
